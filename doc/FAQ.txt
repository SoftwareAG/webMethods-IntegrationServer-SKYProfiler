	Solution:
		You are probably running the command as a low privileged use.
		Invoke command prompt in "Run as Administrator" mode and try to start MongoDB again.
		
9. When I try to start Kafka by running the command 'kafka-server-start.bat ..\..\config\server.properties' I get the following error

	C:\kafka_2.11-0.10.1.1\bin\windows>kafka-server-start.bat ..\..\config\server.pr
	operties
	'wmic' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
	operable program or batch file.
	
	Solution: 
		Append Environment PATH variable with the following location
		"C:\Windows\System32\wbem;C:\Windows\System32;"
		
		C:\Windows\System32\wbem 	- has path for "wmic"
		C:\Windows\System32			- has path for "find"
		
10. When I try to build by running the command 'ant all' I get the following error

	C:\webMethods-IntegrationServer-SKYProfiler-master>ant all
	Buildfile: C:\webMethods-IntegrationServer-SKYProfiler-master\build.xml

	init.maven:

	Total time: 0 seconds
	
	Solution:
		You might have set maven.home property as "maven.home=C:\apache-maven-3.3.9" in build.properties
		Change it to "maven.home=C:/apache-maven-3.3.9"
